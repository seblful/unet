## U-Net: PyTorch Implementation for Biomedical Image Segmentation

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of the U-Net, a convolutional neural network architecture for biomedical image segmentation. The U-Net has been widely used in various medical image analysis tasks.

### Key Features

- Implementation of the U-Net architecture in PyTorch
- Training and evaluation scripts for biomedical image segmentation tasks

### Paper

The implementation is based on the paper "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation" by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox.
